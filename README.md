# My Personal Site

The website for Aervyon.

This is supposedly Version 4. I lost track of versions a long time ago, it could be V5 for all I know.

Certainly isn't V3 though.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run build
```
